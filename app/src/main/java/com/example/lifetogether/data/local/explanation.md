# Package structure for local storage (Room)

## Model:
data/model: This is where you’d place your data models or entities like ListCountEntity.
domain/model: This is where you’d place your domain models, which are often used across different layers of the app.

## Data Access Object (DAO):
data/local: The DAO interfaces, such as ListCountDao, belong here since they are part of the local data source.

## LocalDataSource:
data/local: The LocalDataSource class would be located here as it’s part of the local data handling.

## Repository Interfaces:
domain/repository: The repository interfaces that define the contract for data operations belong here.
data/repository: The concrete implementation of the repository interfaces that interact with the data sources.

## Use Cases/Interactors:
domain/usecase: This is where you’d place your use cases or interactors that contain business logic.

## Remote:
data/remote: This is for remote data handling classes, such as Retrofit service interfaces or remote data sources.

## Callback:
domain/callback: If you have callback interfaces for domain layer operations, they would go here.


# Fetch all data and save to local storage
A better approach would be to fetch the full list details only once and derive the counts from that data. 
Here’s how you can do it:
1. Initial Fetch:
   - When the app starts or reaches the home screen, perform an initial fetch of all list details in a background process.
      
2. Data Storage:
   - Store the fetched data in a central repository or a local cache that can be accessed by different view models.

3. Counts Calculation: 
   - Calculate the item counts from this data and provide them to the home screen view model.
         
4. Data Reuse: 
   - When navigating to individual list screens, use the already fetched data instead of fetching it again.


This way, you’re only fetching the full data once and then reusing it across screens. 
Make sure to handle data updates efficiently so that when an item is added or removed, the counts are updated 
accordingly without needing to re-fetch everything.

# Firestore auto-update and offline capabilities??
You can use Firestore’s offline capabilities by enabling it with Firebase.firestore.setPersistenceEnabled(true) 
and using snapshot listeners to automatically fetch updates when online.

Prompt: "You can use Firestore’s offline capabilities by enabling it with Firebase.firestore.setPersistenceEnabled(true) and using snapshot listeners to automatically fetch updates when online." sounds very interesting and useful. Can you tell me how to do that?


# Data from Room to view models
1. Create a Repository Class: This class will be responsible for all data operations, fetching from Firestore, and storing in Room. 

2. Set Up Room Database: Define your entities and DAOs as usual. 

3. Create Use Cases: Define use cases that interact with the repository. Each use case should represent a single action, 
like “GetListDetails” or “UpdateList”. 

4. Instantiate Repository in ViewModel: Create an instance of your repository directly in your ViewModel.

5. Use Use Cases in ViewModels: Call the appropriate use case in your ViewModel functions to fetch or update data. 

6. Share Data Between ViewModels: To share data between ViewModels, you could use a shared data holder or singleton 
pattern for the repository to ensure all ViewModels are interacting with the same instance and thus, the same data set.

## Simplified example:
```Kotlin
// Repository
class ListsRepository(private val listsDao: ListsDao) {
    fun getAllLists() = listsDao.getAllLists()
    // Add other repository methods here
}

// Use Case
class GetListDetails(private val repository: ListsRepository) {
    operator fun invoke(listId: String) = repository.getListDetails(listId)
}

// ViewModel
class ListViewModel(private val getListDetails: GetListDetails) : ViewModel() {
    // Use the use case to get list details
    fun getListDetails(listId: String): GetListDetails = getListDetails(listId)
}
```

# Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how data flows from a use case to the database tables:

**Use Case**: This is where the action starts. A use case is triggered by the user through the UI, 
which then calls a method in the ViewModel.

**ViewModel**: The ViewModel receives this call and forwards it to the appropriate use case or repository method.

**Repository**: The repository is responsible for deciding where to get data from (local or remote sources) 
and calling the corresponding method in LocalDataSource.

**LocalDataSource**: This class acts as a mediator between the repository and the DAOs. It contains methods 
that call the DAO methods.

**DAO (Data Access Object)**: The DAO directly interacts with the database tables using queries to fetch, 
insert, update, or delete data.

**Room Database**: This is where your entities (tables) are defined, and it provides DAO instances to LocalDataSource.

## Here’s how they interact:
The use case calls a method in ListRepositoryImpl.
ListRepositoryImpl calls a method in LocalDataSource, like getAllListCounts().
LocalDataSource uses listCountDao to perform the actual database operation.
listCountDao interacts with the AppDatabase to perform CRUD operations on ListCountEntity.
