## Here’s a breakdown of each package:
- data: This package contains all classes related to data management, including the Room database, Firebase services, data models, 
and repositories. 
- di: This package is dedicated to setting up dependency injection with Hilt, defining modules that provide instances of classes 
needed throughout the app.
- domain: The domain layer holds the business logic of the application. It includes use cases that encapsulate specific business 
rules and interfaces for data repositories.
- ui: The presentation layer where all UI-related components live. It’s further divided into common reusable composables, 
feature-specific UI components, theming, and ViewModels.
- util: A package for utility classes and functions that provide common functionality across the application.

This structure follows the principles of Clean Architecture, ensuring that each layer has a clear responsibility and that the 
dependencies flow inwards.

The separation of concerns makes it easier to maintain and test your application. Remember to keep your code modular and avoid 
tight coupling between components to ensure flexibility and ease of changes in the future.


## From send button click to database
Here’s a high-level overview of the sequence of events and interactions between different components in your chat application 
when a user clicks the send button:

1. UI Layer (Screen/Composable): The user enters their message into the input field and clicks the send button on the ChatScreen.
2. Event Handling: The click event is captured by the ChatScreen, which then calls a function in the associated ChatViewModel.
3. ChatViewModel: The ChatViewModel receives the message content and constructs a Message domain model object with the necessary 
information (sender, receiver, content, timestamp).
4. Use Case Invocation: The ChatViewModel invokes the SendMessageUseCase, passing the Message object as a parameter.
5. Execute Use Case: The SendMessageUseCase executes its operator function, which calls the sendMessage method on the MessageRepository 
interface.
6. Repository Implementation: The MessageRepositoryImpl, which is the implementation of the MessageRepository interface, takes over 
and handles the logic to send the message. This involves interacting with the data layer.
7. Data Layer Interaction: The MessageRepositoryImpl converts the Message domain model into a MessageEntity data model if necessary 
and uses Firebase Realtime Database (or any other configured service) to send the message.
8. Database/Service: The message is sent to the Firebase Realtime Database, which stores the message and delivers it to the receiver.
9. UI Update: Upon successful sending, the ChatViewModel updates the UI state to reflect the sent message in the chat history.
10. Error Handling: If there’s an error at any point, the ChatViewModel handles it by updating the UI state to show an error message.

### Here’s a simplified code flow that corresponds to the above steps:
```
// Step 1 & 2: ChatScreen.kt
@Composable
fun ChatScreen(viewModel: ChatViewModel) {
    // ... UI code ...
    Button(onClick = {
        viewModel.onSendClicked(messageText)
    }) {
        Text("Send")
    }
}

// Step 3 & 4: ChatViewModel.kt
class ChatViewModel(private val sendMessageUseCase: SendMessageUseCase) : ViewModel() {
    fun onSendClicked(content: String) {
        val message = Message(/* senderId, receiverId, content, timestamp */)
        sendMessageUseCase(message)
    }
}

// Step 5 & 6: SendMessageUseCase.kt
class SendMessageUseCase(private val messageRepository: MessageRepository) {
    operator fun invoke(message: Message) {
        messageRepository.sendMessage(message)
    }
}

// Step 7: MessageRepositoryImpl.kt
class MessageRepositoryImpl : MessageRepository {
    override fun sendMessage(message: Message) {
        val messageEntity = MessageEntity(/* id, senderId, receiverId, content, timestamp */)
        // Step 7 & 8: Send message using Firebase Realtime Database
    }
}
```
